    <img src="images/stormblade.webp" alt="Stormblade">
    <p>Valeria Stormblade, born in the heart of the Stormpeak Mountains, was raised by a clan of fierce warriors. From a young age, she was trained in both combat and strategy, earning her name by mastering the legendary Stormbladeâ€”a weapon said to be forged from the heart of a fallen star. Valeria became known across the realms for her unmatched skill and her unwavering dedication to justice. She now roams the lands as a protector of the weak, guided by the ancient codes of her ancestors.</p>
